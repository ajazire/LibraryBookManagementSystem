# Project Report: Library System Backend

### Introduction
This project involves the development of a Java-based library system backend application. It utilizes Spring Boot and a relational database to provide RESTful APIs for managing books, users, and loans. The project incorporates GitHub's tools for continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and code analysis.

### Development Process

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The project started by creating the basic structure using Spring Boot.
   - PostgreSQL was chosen as the database, and the RESTful API endpoints were defined for managing library resources.

2. **Version Control**:
   - **GitHub** was used to manage all code changes. The project follows a structured GitFlow branching strategy for managing development and releases.
   - Commits were tagged using **Semantic Versioning**, making it easy to track releases and maintain consistency across versions.

3. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**:
   - **GitHub Actions** was configured to run tests automatically upon code pushes. This pipeline ensures that the code passes all quality checks before merging into the `main` branch.
   - A **Continuous Deployment** pipeline was set up to automatically deploy the application to **Heroku** upon successful build and test.
   
4. **Code Quality and Security**:
   - **CodeQL** was integrated to identify potential security vulnerabilities and maintain code quality. Any detected issues were fixed promptly, ensuring a secure and maintainable codebase.
   
5. **Collaboration**:
   - GitHub Issues were used to track bugs and feature requests throughout the project.
   - All changes were reviewed through pull requests, ensuring code quality and proper documentation of new features or bug fixes.
   
6. **GitHub Releases**:
   - Releases were created for each major version using **GitHub Releases**. Each release included detailed notes on the changes and improvements made.

### Challenges and Learning Process

1. **Challenge: CI/CD Integration**:
   - Setting up **GitHub Actions** and automating the entire deployment process presented a learning curve. We had to understand how to configure workflows and deploy the application efficiently.
   
   **Solution**: Leveraged documentation and examples to create customized workflows that suit the projectâ€™s needs, ultimately automating the build, test, and deploy processes.

2. **Challenge: Semantic Versioning**:
   - Ensuring proper tagging of commits using **Semantic Versioning** required coordination across branches and during releases.

   **Solution**: Established a process for tagging before every release, incorporating it into the CI/CD pipeline to minimize manual oversight.

3. **GitHub Facilitated Project Management**:
   - **GitHub Actions** automated the testing and deployment, significantly speeding up the development cycle.
   - **GitHub Issues** streamlined task management, and the integrated pull request process ensured that every change was reviewed thoroughly.
   - **GitHub Releases** and tagging helped maintain a clear and structured version history.

### Conclusion
This project allowed us as Group 4 to gain hands-on experience with modern development practices, including microservice architecture, CI/CD pipelines, and GitHub's project management features. The combination of automated tools and a structured approach to collaboration made the development process efficient and manageable.
