Code of Conduct
We follow the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct to ensure a welcoming environment. Please read and adhere to it when interacting in this project.

Project Setup
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ajazire/LibraryBookManagementSystem.git
cd CRUDApplication
Set up the database (PostgreSQL is used by default):

Create the required database as outlined in the README.md.
Install project dependencies:

Build the application using Maven:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Run tests:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
Branching Strategy
We follow GitFlow for managing branches:

main: The stable branch for production-ready code.
develop: The default branch for ongoing development.
feature/feature-name: Branch off from develop for individual features.
release/release-version: Branch for preparing releases.
hotfix/fix-description: For urgent bug fixes on main.
Continuous Integration and Deployment
We use GitHub Actions to manage CI/CD pipelines.

Continuous Integration (CI):

Code is automatically tested for each pull request. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a PR.
Continuous Deployment (CD):

Once changes are merged into main, the application is automatically deployed to Heroku (or another cloud platform).
Pipeline setup:

The CI/CD pipeline includes build, testing, and deployment stages. Modify the .github/workflows files as necessary to suit your environment.
GitHub Issues
We use GitHub Issues to track:

Bugs
Feature requests
Enhancements
If you find a bug or have an idea for improvement, please open a new issue and provide as much detail as possible.

Pull Requests
Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (feature/feature-name or fix/issue-name).
Make your changes.
Ensure the code passes all tests locally.
Submit a pull request with a detailed explanation of the changes.
All pull requests will be reviewed by project maintainers. Ensure your PR adheres to the project's coding standards.

Code Quality and Security
We use CodeQL to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

Ensure that your code passes all code quality checks before creating a PR.
Code Analysis: Run static code analysis locally using the configured tools (e.g., SonarQube, PMD).
Versioning
We follow Semantic Versioning for tagging releases (e.g., v1.0.0).

Each major version includes a release with notes on new features, bug fixes, and changes.
Before merging to main, ensure the branch is tagged with the appropriate version:
bash
Copy code
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin --tags
Collaborators
Collaborators are added by the repository owner and must follow the contributing guidelines.
Ensure all contributions are made through pull requests for structured code reviews.
